            Analysing pre- and post-tests results (Fig. 12) it can be noticed that both VR and traditional auditory laboratory have a positive effect on the knowledge of the subject (before the pretest students had only read a manual). The post-test conducted after 3 days of education indicates an advantage of VR laboratory over the traditional approachâ€”students participating in the VR sessions passed the test 25,1 % better. It is especially visible in case of six first questions regarding construction of electric machines. In VR, students had an opportunity to assemble and disassemble machines, see every part and inspect them in the context of the whole machine. Auditory classes give no such possibility (e.g. taking out windings from a rotor). What is more, free comments from students allow us to suspect that classes utilizing attractive VR didactic methods are more memorable than traditional ones.
